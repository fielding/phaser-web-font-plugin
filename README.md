Phaser Web Font Plugin
======================
After running in to a weird issue loading web fonts and being unable to get any of the plugins that previously worked to work, I decided to put together my own. This one targets Phaser 3.24.1, but I wouldn't be surprised if it worked for <insert your Phaser version here>.

*warning*: Currently, my main phaser project uses Phaser v3.24.1, so my plugins currently target that version of Phaser. Some will work fine with the latest, some have native suppoort in the latest version, and others will probably blow up with any version other than 3.24.1.
